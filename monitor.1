a backup):

.nf

monitor \-\-highlight \-\-shell 'du \-kx | sort \-nr'

.SH NOTE
The default behavior is to avoid use of the shell, making
\fBmonitor\fR an \*(lqadverbial\*(rq command with the same syntax as
\fBnice\fR(1), \fBnohup\fR(1) etc.
The \fB--shell\fR option changes this, concanenating all the arguments
and passing them to the shell.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SHELL
The \fB--shell\fR option will use this as the shell.
If it is not set then it will search the path for \fBsh\fR.

The default is 8.
.SH BUGS
The \fB--highlight\fR option doesn't know about insertions (or deletions).
